Diferencias unset y destroy session:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4303311/what-is-the-difference-between-session-unset-and-session-destroy-in-php



session_unset just clears the $_SESSION variable. It’s equivalent to doing:

$_SESSION = array();

So this does only affect the local $_SESSION variable instance but not the session data in the session storage.

In contrast to that, session_destroy destroys the session data that is stored in the session storage (e.g. the session file in the file system).

Everything else remains unchanged.
