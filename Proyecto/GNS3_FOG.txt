  We found the following interfaces on your system:
      * ens3 - 192.168.1.5/24

Would you like to change the default network interface from ens3? NO

Would you like to setup a router address for the DHCP server? [Y/n] YES (En esta LAN ya hay un Servidor DHCP, tenemos que especificar su ruta)

Normalmente lo "adivina" y te pregunta si es el correcto. Puedes especificarlo: 192.168.1.1

Would you like DHCP to handle DNS? NO(Creo que aquí la respuesta no importa si luego le decimos que no queremos usar FOG como servidor DHCP)


Would you like to use the FOG server for dhcp service? [Y/n] n
No. DHCP addresses will be provided by the infrastructure's DHCP server. Having multiple DHCP servers on a single network causes a race condition for the clients, and potentially conflicting IP addresses if they are issuing out addresses within the same range.


This version of FOG has internationalization support, would you like to install the additional language packs? [Y/n]
Choose Yes if you'd like to install additional languages
